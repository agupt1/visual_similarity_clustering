# visual_similarity_clustering

## This project developed a visual clustering solution to identify key visual attributes in marketing images that drive consumer engagement, providing actionable insights for content optimization.
### The project can be divided into the following parts:

- 01.preprocess_data: The purpose of this script is to preprocess the image data which can include noise reduction, color correction, resizing, grayscale conversion, etc.
- 02.get_embeddings: The purpose of this script is to generate image embeddings which act as the vector representations of the image attributes.
- 03.get_visual_similarity_clusters.ipynb: The purpose of this script is to cluster the image embeddings from the previous step into visually similar groups.

The project relies on publicly available fashion dataset with documentation [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitinsss/fashion-dataset-with-over-15000-labelled-images).
